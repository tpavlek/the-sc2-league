Membership Processes
=====================

Due to the potential disclosing of information not ready for public consumption, we need to ensure that a system of
trust exists on the mailing list, therefore the following processes will be observed for the adding of new members:

Sponsors
--------
When a new member applies, he is encouraged to seek out one of the members who is already a part of the league to 
sponsor his application. This will give the applicant an advocate on the private mailing list to make a case on his
behalf. This is not required, however it is encouraged.

Application
------------
An application to the mailing list can be done using the request membership form available on the Google group. This
 group is located at [http://priv.thesc2league.com](http://priv.thesc2league.com). If the
applicant wishes to solicit discussion about his application or wishes to seek out a sponsor, then the applicant should
make a post on the public mailing list discussing his application.

Voting
-------
After the applicant has been discussed, his application will be put to a vote to the current sitting members who can either
vote for or against the application. In order to be accepted, the application must recieve 50%+1 of the votes that were
cast. That is, he does not require a majority of the members to vote in favour, just a majority of the members who showed
up to vote. A vote can be active for no less than 48 hours, unless majority of the total members has been recieved in less
than that.
